<ol>
<li>C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use.</li><br>
<li>It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows.</li><br>
<li>In 1972, a great computer scientist Dennis Ritchie created a new programming language called ‘C’ at the Bell Laboratories.</li><br>
<li>It was created from ‘ALGOL’, ‘BCPL’ and ‘B’ programming languages. ‘C’ programming language contains all the features of these languages and many more additional concepts that make it unique from other languages.</li><br>
<li> C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.</li><br>
<li>It is a very popular language, despite being old.</li><br>
<li>It is a robust language.</li><br>
<li>It is a low level programming language. </li><br>
<li>It is a procedure and structure oriented language.</li><br>
<li>It is a compiled language. A compiler is a special tool that compiles the program and converts it into the object file which is machine readable. After the compilation process, the linker will combine different object files and creates a single executable file to run the program.</li><br>
<li>It is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies.</li><br>
<li>If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar.</li><br>


<li>Requirements:<ul>
<li>A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code.</li>
<li>A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand.</li>
<li>If you are comfortable with online compiler,you can use it.</li>
</ul></li><br>

<p>This tutorial will help you to learn the basics of C programing languages.Videos are available in this website for further reference and undrstanding.
